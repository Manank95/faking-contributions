##Faking Contributions

GitHub has a feature where commits can be amended with older dates.

For the lols (and I was bored), I decided to create a program that would fill GitHub's contributions calendar.

###Instructions
Create a GitHub repository to hold the fake commits

Run FakingContributions.java to generate the date file

Then run
    
    fc.bat username password repository

example:

    fc.bat justicesuh hunter2 fake-commits
    
The fake contributions generated by this script can be found [here](https://github.com/justicesuh/for-the-lols).
